#Part 2
As a member of the public,
# So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
# I’d like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
#
# As a system maintainer,
# So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
# I’d like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity, which is by default 20.
